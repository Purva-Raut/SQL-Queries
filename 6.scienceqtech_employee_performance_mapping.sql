table.

Views can be used for a few reasons. Some of the main reasons are as follows:

*To simplify database structure to the individuals using it
*As a security mechanism to DBAs for allowing users to access data without granting them permissions to 
directly access the underlying base tables
*To provide backward compatibility to applications that are using our database */

represent the subtotals, which are commonly referred to as super-aggregate rows, along with the grand total row. 
By using the ROLLUP option, you can use a single query to generate multiple grouping sets.
To make the output more readable, you can use the COALESCE() function to substitute the NULL value*/
